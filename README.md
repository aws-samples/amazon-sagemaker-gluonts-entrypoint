## Example Entrypoint Scripts to run GluonTS on Amazon SageMaker

This repository contains the example that supplement the
[blog post](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/industries/novartis-ag-uses-amazon-sagemaker-and-gluonts-for-demand-forecasting/)
on using [GluonTS](https://ts.gluon.ai/) to develop custom forecasting models on
[Amazon SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/), and to generate forecasts
with those custom models.

The sample notebooks demonstrate how to experiment with multiple models quicker
with only parameteric changes to the entrypoint train script.

## Implementation notes

The entrypoint train script utilizes GluonTS to work with time series data in
a simpler fashion, and to access many state-of-the-art custom models in the
GluonTS library. The novelties demonstrated by the script include:

- a single generic train script that supports multiple built-in algorithms in
  GluonTS.

- demonstrate how to write notebooks and entrypoint scripts in modular style.

- the train script passes through hyperparameters it receives as command line
  arguments, directly to the specified GluonTS estimator.

  * The entrypoint train script does not need to explicitly declare all those
    hyperpameters in its body.

  * This functionality utilizes another sample repository:
    [aws-samples/amazon-sagemaker-entrypoint-utilities](https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-sagemaker-entrypoint-utilities),
    a dependency that the entrypoint train script declares in its
    `requirements.txt`

- at the end of training, the train script performs backtesting on a test
  split. Then, the script outputs to files the backtest performance metrics,
  the forecasts resulted from test split, and backtest plots of all timeseries
  as montages and individual plots.

  * This is done by design, and the aim is to let data scientists quickly
    analyze their model performance without having to separately run inferences
    (and additional downstream tasks for plotting etc.).

  * This functionality utilizes another sample repository:
    [aws-samples/smallmatter-package](https://github.com/aws-samples/smallmatter-package),
    a dependency that the entrypoint train script declares in its
    `requirements.txt`
